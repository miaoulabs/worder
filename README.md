Write words with fire!

This is something I threw together the night before heading to Burning Man 2017, where we installed a single flamepixel
panel in our camp (KAOS).  Liz created the font during our drive from Reno to Gerlach!

The intent was to replace random characters with the KAOS symbol, but that proved too annoying to read so we removed
this feature. We also intended to mess with the text and remove political words (because that has no place at BM)
but the latter proved unnecessary.
